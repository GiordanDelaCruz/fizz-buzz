# fizz-buzz
This code is based on a game children play in England where they count from 1 to 100. 
The rules are;
    1) For every multiple of 3, you say "Fizz".
    2) For every multiple of 5, you say "Buzz". 
    3) For every multiple of 3 &amp; 5, you say "FizzBuzz".

Note: This code written as little challenge since some interviewers ask this question 
      when they wish to test a applicants programming ability.
      
      This code was written with little time and effort, so it is not very formal. It 
      does however get the job done!
